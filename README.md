### Data Sources

In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project will put those skills to the test.

Used [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API to collect posts from two subreddits. 
Used NLP to train classifiers to predict what subreddit a given post originated from.
(binary classification problem.)
