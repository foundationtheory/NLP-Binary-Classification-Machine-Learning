### Data Sources

In this project, I implement webscraping through the use of Reddits Pushshift API, and apply Natural Language Processing to create a binary classification problem that I test a number of classification models against.

Used [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API to collect posts from two subreddits. 
Used NLP to train classifiers to predict what subreddit a given post originated from.
